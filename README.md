## Abstract
Owning a portfolio of Airbnb rentals is a smart way to increase oneâ€™s annual income. In this paper, we will try to recommend in which neighbourhood in New York one should invest in a successful Airbnb business. We will describe this idea and its aspects in more detail like how different neighbourhoods, prices, availabilities and other items can have an impact on our results. A dataset from Kaggle will be used for data analysis. Then, the technologies and algorithms used will be described. Next, we will re-implement the mentioned algorithms and discuss how they work on our dataset.
